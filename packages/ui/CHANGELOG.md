# @modern-admin/ui

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`48edd1d`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/48edd1da4dee37357d6c550f1e0a5df0e2e54cdc) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - Fix styling and bundling for apps that build their own copy of the admin SPA.

  Three bugs made a custom SPA impossible to build against the published
  packages, forcing consumers to fork `@modern-admin/web` wholesale:

  - **Tailwind classes went missing.** `@modern-admin/ui/styles.css` scanned its
    sibling with `@source "../../react/src/**"`, a relative hop that only
    resolves when node_modules is hoisted. Under bun's isolated store (or pnpm)
    it matched zero files and every class used only by `@modern-admin/react` —
    the whole login page — was dropped from the bundle. Each package now scans
    itself, and apps import the new `@modern-admin/react/styles.css`, which
    composes `@modern-admin/ui/styles.css` on top. `@import` resolves package
    specifiers; `@source` never could.
  - **The published output was unimportable.** The shared React tsconfig used
    `jsx: "preserve"`, so `tsc` wrote `foo.jsx` to disk while rewriting import
    specifiers to `foo.js` — bundlers building against `dist/` failed with
    unresolved imports. Now `jsx: "react-jsx"`.
  - **No supported way to build a custom bundle.** `@modern-admin/web/vite` now
    exports `defineAdminAppConfig()` with the dev server, the
    `dist/standalone/` layout `ModernAdminStaticUiModule` expects, precompressed
    assets and prefetch hints. `packages/web` uses the same factory, so the two
    cannot drift.

  **Breaking:** `mount()` no longer imports the stylesheet — a second Tailwind
  root would compile the framework CSS twice and without the app's own
  `@source`. Apps calling `mount()` directly must now import
  `@modern-admin/react/styles.css` themselves, ideally from their own Tailwind
  root. The prebuilt standalone bundle is unaffected.

### Minor Changes

- [`69606d4`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/69606d4c2e2ee6204dde978fa59e4454e3ca7ac2) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - harden search fallback scan, avoid payload mutation in json-by-key, paginate cache invalidateTags, and make history writes fire-and-forget

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`68ee72e`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/68ee72e721babf28158274b6fe98e3af8148cf92) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - Republish with correct internal dependency ranges. 0.2.0 was published with internal `@modern-admin/*` dependencies pinned to the stale exact version `0.1.1` (bun substitutes `workspace:` ranges from a bun.lock that `changeset version` had not refreshed), which broke consumers with nested-copy resolution errors (`Export named 'recordsTag' not found`). Internal ranges are now published as `^<version>` (`workspace:^`), the release pipeline syncs bun.lock workspace versions after versioning, and publishing aborts if a packed tarball carries a wrong internal range.
