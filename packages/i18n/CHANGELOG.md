# @modern-admin/i18n

## 0.6.0

### Patch Changes

- [`3d2a207`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/3d2a2077a466e87da55bf162dcafdb9a8b9bd652) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - Refresh the monorepo to the latest stable dependency lines, including
  TypeScript 7, Vite 8.2, TanStack Table 9, BullMQ 6, ioredis 6, Prisma 7.9,
  NestJS 11.2, and the current React/UI toolchain. The table integration now
  uses TanStack Table 9's explicit feature API, and the queue lock processor uses
  BullMQ 6's backend client API. TypeScript 6 remains installed only as the
  temporary JavaScript Compiler API compatibility layer required by ESLint and
  declaration tooling while project compilation runs on TypeScript 7.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [`4251f7a`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/4251f7a6ea01ad80fbd5515a27cec2e138d2ccb5) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - Harden server caching across processes and expose cache observability.

### Patch Changes

- [`4251f7a`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/4251f7a6ea01ad80fbd5515a27cec2e138d2ccb5) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - Harden server caching across processes and expose cache observability.

  - Route all framework reads, writes, and invalidations through a fail-open
    `CacheRuntime` with tag-generation fencing, invalidation retry/quarantine,
    TTL jitter, metrics, and optional distributed single-flight locks.
  - Make Redis value/tag/reverse-index writes atomic, add cross-instance tag
    epochs, token-safe locks, exact delete/overwrite cleanup, and monotonic tag
    TTLs.
  - Version and canonicalize action and HTTP keys, fix bounded in-memory LRU tag
    semantics, and actively revoke cached role permissions across replicas.
  - Scope HTTP entries per principal, bypass dynamic access predicates, and tie
    cached responses to role-permission invalidation.
  - Add protected cache stats/reset/resource-invalidation endpoints and a
    localized Cache diagnostics screen.

- [`4251f7a`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/4251f7a6ea01ad80fbd5515a27cec2e138d2ccb5) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - Added localized text search for resources on the admin home page and hid the
  native search reset control when an Input provides its own clear button. Select
  menus now retain their height after the down-scroll indicator disappears.
  JSON properties in the show view now offer a copy button.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- [`21f3457`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/21f3457c8260279be5055bc1f7a76be3ea5fee46) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - modal action title

- [`21f3457`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/21f3457c8260279be5055bc1f7a76be3ea5fee46) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - Confirm dialogs no longer default to the delete wording. A guarded custom action now shows a neutral "Confirm action" title with a "Confirm" button; only destructive confirms keep "Delete this record?" / "Delete". Adds `common:confirmAction` and `common:confirm` to every locale.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- [`596ad7d`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/596ad7dd27ec3da2538afcbeb342cac1e707c8e5) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - Fixed sidebar animations performance and resource actions config

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [`cdc8639`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/cdc86393f211e8d10b856d9091baa910a11e739f) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - enhanced chart builder functionality

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`69606d4`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/69606d4c2e2ee6204dde978fa59e4454e3ca7ac2) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - harden search fallback scan, avoid payload mutation in json-by-key, paginate cache invalidateTags, and make history writes fire-and-forget

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`68ee72e`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/68ee72e721babf28158274b6fe98e3af8148cf92) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - Republish with correct internal dependency ranges. 0.2.0 was published with internal `@modern-admin/*` dependencies pinned to the stale exact version `0.1.1` (bun substitutes `workspace:` ranges from a bun.lock that `changeset version` had not refreshed), which broke consumers with nested-copy resolution errors (`Export named 'recordsTag' not found`). Internal ranges are now published as `^<version>` (`workspace:^`), the release pipeline syncs bun.lock workspace versions after versioning, and publishing aborts if a packed tarball carries a wrong internal range.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`c151019`](https://github.com/modern-admin/modern-admin/commit/c151019f159f41c1574ae6993f582bfd21987983) Thanks [@SergiyIva](https://github.com/SergiyIva)! - Add npm package metadata: a per-package README (install + links back to the Modern Admin repo) plus `homepage` and `keywords` fields for better discoverability on npm.
